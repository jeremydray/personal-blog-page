## **1.    Introduction**

The goal of this project was to provide the user input functionality for adding personal blog posts to a separate page. The user has the ability to assign their name, the title of their post, and the message/content they wish to provide. The user will then be automatically re-directed to the page that contains the blog post, with the ability to navigate back to the landing page and add more posts if desired. These inputs are also stored locally on the users machine, so there is the option to remove these posts from the page/local storage. Finally there is an option to toggle light and dark modes based on the user's preferences.
